== Icons get pushed to other pages ==
  This is the default behavior of SpringBoard; SpringJumps does not try to override this. If you need a the ability to keep a large collection of icons separated from others, you may wish to try BigBoss's [http://cydia.thebigboss.org/moreinfo/categories.php Categories] program (available in Cydia).

== More than nine pages ==
  SpringBoard only supports nine pages of icons. SpringJumps does not create pages, it simply switches to SpringBoard's existing pages. If you want to be able to create your own "pages", you may wish to try BigBoss's [http://cydia.thebigboss.org/moreinfo/categories.php Categories] program (available in Cydia).

SpringJumps allows for the creation of shortcut icons that, when tapped, will "jump" to the associated SpringBoard page. This provides a quick way of navigating SpringBoard without having to endlessly swipe to find a given application.

First, a simple [video demonstration](http://jp.youtube.com/watch?v=vOGC-V7xaQw).


Below is an example of one possible usage - using the first SpringBoard page to hold a collection of links to other pages:

Here is another usage - keeping a set of links in the dock to quickly jump to a SpringBoard page:

Here is the same usage example using custom titles (set with the preferences application) and icons (via [saurik's WinterBoard](http://www.saurik.com/id/9)) (the icons used are from the [Tango icon-set](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library)):
